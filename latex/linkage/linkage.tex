\chapter{Disjoint path in decomposable digraphs}
\label{chap:linkage}
In this chapter we will cover the Linkage problem given a set a decomposable digraph $D$ and a set of terminals $\Pi$ to be linked. 
We will explaining the problem and shortly show why the problem is interresting (NP-complete). 
After this we will in \autoref{sec:lQuasi} show that the linkage problem is polynomial solveable in $\phi$-decomposable digraph as long as $\phi$ is a linkage ejector after that we will show that $\phi_1$ is a linkeage ejector meaning that the linkage problem is solveable for quasi-transitive digraphs(all of this is only true if the number of pairs needed linking is fixed). Then in \autoref{sec:lLocally} we will cover the 3 different subclasses a locally semicomplete digraph can be a part of, and solve the $k$-linkage problem for those in polynomial time for a fixed $k$.
