\chapter{Disjoint path in decomposable digraphs}
\label{chap:linkage}
In this chapter we will cover the Linkage problem given a decomposable digraph $D$ and a set of terminals $\Pi$ to be linked. 
We will explaining the problem and shortly show why the problem is NP-complete. 
After this we will in \autoref{sec:lQuasi} show that the linkage problem is polynomially solvable in $\phi$-decomposable digraph if $\phi$ adhere sertent properties. 
After that we will show that $\phi_1$ also adhere to these properties meaning that the linkage problem is solveable for quasi-transitive digraphs (all of this is only true if the number of pairs needed linking is fixed). Then in \autoref{sec:lLocally} we will cover the 3 different subclasses a locally semicomplete digraph can be a part of, and solve the $k$-linkage problem for those in polynomial time for a fixed $k$.
