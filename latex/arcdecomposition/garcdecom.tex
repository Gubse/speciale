First we need to esablish that a spanning subdigraph of a digraph $D$ is a subdigraph $D'\subseteq D$ contaning all the vertices of $D$.
Finding two such subdigraphs in the same graph that are arc disjoint and strong, this is the problem that we are going to cover.
The problem is NP-complete and this is shown by use of the hamilton cycle problem.
Recall from \autoref{sec:class} a k-arc-strong digraph is a digraph where we need to delete at least $k$ arcs before the digraph is no longer strong. 
From this it is clear that for these two subdigraphs to be present in a digraph $D$, it needs to be 2-arc-strong.
We are going to denote these two subdigraphs as $D_1$ and $D_2$ with the arc set $A_1\subseteq A$ and $A_2\subseteq A$ respectively.

We are as we have through the whole thises focused on decomposable digraphs, we are in this chapter going to focus more on using the word composition so it is not confusing since we are looking at when there exists an arc-decomposition in a decomposable digraph.
