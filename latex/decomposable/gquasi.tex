First we need to recall what a quasi transitive digraph is. 
For every triplet $x,y,z$ in a quasi-transitive digraph if $x\rightarrow y$ ($x$ dominates $y$) and $y\rightarrow z$ ($y$ domitaes $z$), then there has to be at least one arc in either dirction between $x$ and $z$. 
When working with quasi-transitive digraphs there are many things you can depend on, things that the structure has already diceded for us.
\begin{lemma}~\cite{banggutin}
    Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are distinct strong components of a quasi-transitive digraph $D$ with at least one arc from $A$ to $B$. Then $A\rightarrow B$.
    \label{lemma:dominatingset}
\end{lemma}
Recall that this means that every vertex in $A$ has an arc to every vertex in $B$.
Like non-strong quasi-transitive digraph we can also say something about strong quasitransitive digraphs.
\begin{lemma}~\cite{banggutin,bangJGT2}
    Let $D$ be a strong quasi-transitive digraph on at least two vertices. Then the following hold:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] $\overline{UG(D)}$ is disconnected;
        \item[(b)] If $S$ and $S'$ are two subdigraphs of $D$ such that $\overline{UG(S)}$ and $\overline{UG(S')}$ are distinct connected components of $\overline{UG(D)}$, then either $S\rightarrow S'$ or $S'\rightarrow S$ or both $S\rightarrow S'$ and $S'\rightarrow S$ in which case $|V(S)|=|V(S')|=1$. 
    \end{itemize} 
    \label{lemma:underlyinggraph}
\end{lemma}
These to lemmas is also a part of proving the one theorem which states that quasi-transitive digraphs can be decomposed no matter if there are strong or nonstrong digraphs. 

\begin{thm}\cite{bangJGT85}
    Let $D$ be a quasi-transitive digraph.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $D$ is not strong, then there exists a transitive acyclic digraph $T$ on $t$ vertices and strong quasitransitive digraphs $H_1,\dots,H_t$ such that $D=T[H_1,\dots,H_t]$.
        \item If $D$ is strong, then there exists a strong semicomplete digraph $S$ on $s$ vertices and quasitransitive digraphs $Q_1,\dots ,Q_s$ such that each $Q_i$ is either a single vertex or is nonstrong and $D=S[Q_1,\dots,Q_s]$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \label{thm:quasidecom}
\end{thm}
This theroem is also what we are going to use more then ones, to prove several of the problem solving theorems through out this thises.
\begin{proof}
    Since we can decompose both strong quasi-transitive digraphs and non-strong quasi-transitive digraph we are going to prove if $D$ is not strong first and there after if $D$ is strong.
    So suppose $D$ is not strong, then we know we can enumerate the strong components in an acyclic order let these be $H_1,\dots , H_t$. \\
    Recall that an acyclic ordering of the strong components does not mean that there is no arcs going back in the ordering, but we will prove that now. \\
    Now from \autoref{lemma:dominatingset} we know that if there is an arc between two of the strong components, one of them dominates the other.
    Let with out loss of generality these set be $H_i$ and $H_j$ and let $H_i\rightarrow H_j$. 
    Then Since $D$ is not-strong $H_j\nrightarrow H_i$ now let say that $H_j \rightarrow H_k$, then since $D$ is quasi-transitive then either $H_k\rightarrow H_i$ or $H_i \rightarrow H_k$. 
    But since $H_i\cup H_j \cup H_k$ is not strong $H_k\nrightarrow H_i$ meaning contracting each $H_i$ for $i=1\dots,t$ we will have a transitive digraph $T$ and we have also shown that there are no backwards going arcs in the ordering meaning that $T$ is not only transitive but acyclic. 
    This end the proof of the non-strong quasi-transitive digraph leving only the strong ones left.\\

    Now suppose that $D$ is a strong quasi-transitive digraph, we now look at the underlying graph $UG(D)$ after this we find the complement of it, $\overline{UG(D)}$ since $D$ is strong we know from \autoref{lemma:underlyinggraph} that $\overline{UG(D)}$ is disconnected, so we find $Q_1,\dots , Q_s$ where $\overline{UG(Q_i)}$ is connected in $\overline{UG(D)}$ $\forall i \in [s]$.\\ 
    Since these subdigraphs $\overline{UG(Q_i)}$ of $\overline{UG(D)}$ is connected we know that $Q_i$ is non-strong or a single vertex in $D$. 
    From the same lemma each $Q_i$ (reprecent $S$ in \autoref{lemma:underlyinggraph}) which means when contracting $Q_i$ $\forall i\in [s]$ into a single vertex $q_i$. 
    Denote $D$ with contracted $Q_i$'s as $S$. 
    We have that every pair of vertex in $S$ have one arc between in either direction or one in both direction making $S$ semicomplte. \\
    This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
From this theorem we can see that quasi-transitive digraphs is totally $\phi_1$-decomposable. 
Since the transitive digraph for the nonstrong quasi-transitive digraphs is acyclic $T\in \phi_1$ and each $H_i$ is itself strong quasi-triansitive digraphs and you can therefore use \autoref{thm:quasidecom} agian.  
For the strong quasi-transitive digraphs $D$, $S$ is semicomplete so $S\in \phi_1$ and each $Q_i \in \phi_1$ because it is either one vertex which is a digraph that is both acyclic and semicomplete or it is non-strong and must be quasi-transitive and therefore \autoref{thm:quasidecom} can be used agian. So every nonstrong and strong quasi-transitive digraphs is totally $\phi_1$-decomposable.
\textcolor{red}{could not find a therom lemma or anything else so i made my own corolary}.
\begin{cor}
    quasi-transitive digraphs $D$ are totally $\phi_1$-decomposable and you can find the decomposition in polynomial time.
\end{cor}
The polynomial time comes from \autoref{thm:phipoly} since it is totally $\phi_i$-decomposable where $i=1$.
