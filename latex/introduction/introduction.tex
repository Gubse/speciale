This chapther is if you do not know what a graph is, there is some notation this thesis may use differently then others and different articles are doing.  
Then in \autoref{sec:complexity} we are going to cover runing time principles and problems that in general are hard to solve, called NP-Complete problems and what these have to do with this thesis. Last \autoref{sec:class} is going to introducing the names of all the classes we are going to use and cover in this thesis.

\chapter{Decomposable Digraphs}
\label{chap:decomposable}
Decomposable digraphs is what we in this thises is focusing on. 
We have introduced short what a decomposable digraph is but there is subclasses to focus on and a lot of other crucial definitions and theroems to cover about these digraphs before delving into the NP-hard problems. First we cover some general things about decomposable digraphs the next section is about quasi-transitive digraphs, and why they are a subclass of decomposable digraphs and $\phi_1$-decomposable digraphs. At the end of the section we proof that these decompositions can be found in polynomial time. Which is going to be crucial for solving some NP-hard problems for this class of digraphs. Then we are going to look at a very general class of digraphs locally semicomplete digraphs, where this class can be split up to 3 different subclasses where 2 of those are decomposable. This is covered in \autoref{sec:locally} and is going to be used in later chapthers.

\chapter{Path cover and hamilton cycles}
\label{chap:hamilton}
In this chapter the focus is the hamilton cycle problem, where we know that if we can solve the path covering problem then we can solve the hamilton cycle problem.\\
The hamilton cycle problem and path covering are closly related since if you find a path covering all vertecies you can find the hamilton cycle in polynomial time. all this is what we in the first section is going to cover, how to get from a path cover, also called hamilton path, to a hamilton cycle in polynomial time and then why both problems is NP-hard problems.\\
The next section is about path-mergeable digraphs and that locally semicomplete digraphs are a subclass of these and how this helps in the path covering problem and hamilton cycle problem. 
%Then state some theorems that says knowing special things about the graph we know when it contain a hamilton cycle. \\
The following section is covering quasi-transitive digraphs and when we know there exists a hamilton cycle in those. Here the decomposition of the quasi-transitive digraphs is going to be a crucial part of proving this. \\
