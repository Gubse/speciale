The Hamilton cycle problem in a digraph is well known, but here is a short explanation of what that is.
When we define what a Hamiltonian digraph is, we first have to explain what a Hamilton cycle is. 
A Hamilton cycle is a directed cycle $C_H$ in a digraph that contains every vertex in the digraph $\forall v\in V(D),\ v\in C_H$.\\
\begin{definition}
    A Hamiltonian digraph is a graph containing a Hamilton cycle. 
\end{definition} 
We can also define digraphs called traceable digraphs:
\begin{definition}
    A traceable digraph is a digraph containing a Hamilton path.
\end{definition}
A Hamilton path is a path containing all vertices of the digraph.\\
It is NP-complete to find out whether an arbitrary given digraph is traceble or Hamiltonian.
Before going into why the problems are NP, we are going to state some obvious conditions for graphs to be traceable or Hamiltonian. \\
For a digraph to be traceable, it needs to be semi-connected, and for a digraph to be Hamiltonian, it needs to be strong. Since a Hamilton cycle is a cycle factor in a digraph $D$ hence a condition for a digraph to be Hamiltonian is that it need to contain a cycle factor.\\
This is all explained and proven in the book 'Digraph', written by Bang-Jensen and Gutin \cite{banggutin}. 
%We are going to show (shortly explain) why the Hamilton path problem is \textcolor{red}{NP-Hard} by reducing a problem we know is NP to the Hamilton path problem.
%Then we are going to show that if we know that a digraph is traceable it takes polynomial time to figure out wheter it is Hamiltonian too, making the traceable problem \textcolor{red}{NP-Hard} too.
%Because if we in polynomial time could figure out wheter a arbitrary digraph is traceable you know that if it is not, it is defenatly not Hamiltonian. 
%And if it is you can in polynomial time figure out if it is Hamiltonian, making the hamton cycle problem a polynomial time solution problem (not \textcolor{red}{NP-Hard}).
